System design questions are a common component of technical interviews, especially for roles that require a strong understanding of building scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. Here are some of the most common system design questions:
Design a URL Shortening Service: Create a service like Bitly that takes a long URL and converts it into a short, unique identifier.


Designing a URL Shortening Service involves several components, including a web application, a database to store mappings, and a way to generate unique identifiers. Here's a high-level design:

1. **User Interface**:
   - Users input a long URL.
   - Upon submission, the system generates a unique short URL.

2. **Shortening Algorithm**:
   - Use a combination of hashing and encoding to generate a unique, short identifier.
   - This can involve techniques like Base62 encoding to generate a short, alphanumeric string from an ID.

3. **Database**:
   - Use a database to store the mappings between short and long URLs.
   - The schema might include columns for short URL, long URL, timestamp, and metadata.
   - Consider using a distributed or sharded database for scalability.

4. **API Layer**:
   - Expose APIs for creating short URLs and resolving short URLs to their original form.
   - Use HTTP methods like POST and GET to handle these operations.

5. **Redirection**:
   - When a user accesses the short URL, the service looks up the short URL in the database to find the corresponding long URL.
   - It then performs a 301 or 302 redirect to the original URL.

6. **Load Balancing and Scaling**:
   - Use load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.
   - Scale horizontally by adding more servers to handle increased load.

7. **Caching**:
   - Implement caching to reduce the number of database queries, especially for frequently accessed URLs.
   - Consider using a distributed caching system like Redis or Memcached.

8. **Analytics and Monitoring**:
   - Track usage statistics, such as the number of times a short URL is accessed.
   - Use monitoring tools to track server performance, error rates, and other metrics.

9. **Security**:
   - Implement measures to prevent abuse, such as rate limiting and CAPTCHA verification.
   - Use HTTPS to secure data in transit.

10. **Expiration and Cleanup**:
    - Implement a policy to expire short URLs after a certain period or a number of accesses.
    - Regularly clean up expired mappings from the database.

11. **Error Handling**:
    - Handle cases where a short URL doesn't exist or when there are errors in the request gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.

12. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:
    - Regularly back up the database and implement disaster recovery procedures to ensure data integrity.

13. **Logging and Auditing**:
    - Log all actions taken within the system for auditing purposes. This includes URL creations, redirections, and any errors that occur.

Remember that this is a high-level design, and there are many implementation details and optimizations that can be applied based on specific requirements and constraints. Additionally, testing and performance tuning will be crucial in making the service robust and efficient.


Low level design : 
Low-level design (LLD) is the process of converting a high-level design into a detailed technical blueprint.
